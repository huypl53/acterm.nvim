1. acterm.nvim                                       *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim*

A focused, floating terminal workspace for Neovim: a live sidebar plus a main
terminal pane.




WHY ACTERM.NVIM                      *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-why-acterm.nvim*

- **Stay oriented**: Always see your terminal list and current selection.
- **Fast switching**: Jump between sessions without leaving the UI.
- **Signal, not noise**: Live activity status tells you what’s running.
- **Compact workflow**: One UI for create, rename, and navigate.


QUICK START                              *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-quick-start*

1. Install the plugin.
2. Add `require('acterm').setup({})` to your config.
3. Run `:AcTermUI` and start a terminal with `n` in the sidebar.


FEATURES                                    *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-features*

- **Two-pane floating UI**: Sidebar terminal list + main terminal view
- **Multiple terminals**: Create and manage multiple terminal sessions
- **Easy navigation**: Cycle through terminals with keyboard shortcuts
- **Dynamic resizing**: Automatically adjusts when Neovim window is resized
- **Toggle sidebar**: Hide/show sidebar for more terminal space
- **Silent cycling**: Cycle terminals without losing focus
- **Customizable layout**: Configure sidebar width, main pane size, gap, and position
- **Relative sizing**: Specify sizes as percentages (0-1.0) or absolute values
- **Seamless borders**: Shared border between sidebar and main pane for a clean look
- **Live status**: Activity-based running/idle indicators
- **Rename terminals**: Give custom names to terminals for easy identification
- **Focus sidebar**: Jump to sidebar from anywhere with a keybinding
- **Clean UI**: Rounded borders, transparency support, and centered layout

CONFIGURATION                          *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-configuration*


DEFAULT CONFIGURATION ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      sidebar = {
        width = 25,           -- Sidebar width (or 0.2 for 20% of screen)
      },
      main = {
        width = 80,           -- Main pane width (or 0.6 for 60% of screen)
        height = 30,          -- Main pane height (or 0.6 for 60% of screen)
      },
      gap = 0,                -- Gap between panes (0 for seamless borders)
      layout = 'horizontal',  -- Layout direction ('horizontal' or 'vertical')
      auto_create = true,     -- Auto-create terminal when opening UI
      wrap_around = true,     -- Wrap around when cycling terminals
      border = 'rounded',     -- Border style
      seamless_borders = true, -- Share border between panes
      winblend = 10,          -- Window transparency (0-100)
      activity = {
        enabled = true,       -- Track terminal activity for status
        poll_ms = 200,        -- Sidebar refresh interval while open
        idle_ms = 1000,       -- Idle threshold for status (ms)
        debounce_ms = 100,    -- Wait for output to pause before refreshing (reduces overhead)
      },
      status_icons = {        -- Status indicators for terminals
        running = '',        -- Icon for running terminals
        idle = '',           -- Icon for idle terminals
      },
      keys = {
        toggle = '<leader>tt',    -- Toggle UI
        new = '<leader>tn',       -- Create new terminal
        next = '<leader>tj',      -- Next terminal
        prev = '<leader>tk',      -- Previous terminal
        focus_sidebar = '<leader>ts', -- Focus sidebar
        toggle_sidebar = '<leader>tp', -- Toggle sidebar visibility
      },
      exit_key = 'q',            -- Key to close UI (works in both sidebar and main window)
      custom_commands = {},      -- Named terminal commands with keybindings
    })
<


BORDER STYLES ~

Available border styles: - `none` - No border - `single` - Single line border -
`double` - Double line border - `rounded` - Rounded corners (default) - `solid`
- Solid border - `shadow` - Drop shadow


RELATIVE VS ABSOLUTE SIZING ~

Sizes can be specified as: - **Relative (0-1.0)**: `width = 0.5` means 50% of
screen width - **Absolute (>= 1)**: `width = 80` means 80 columns

>lua
    -- Relative sizing (recommended for responsiveness)
    sidebar = { width = 0.2 },  -- 20% of screen
    main = { width = 0.6, height = 0.6 },  -- 60% of screen
    
    -- Absolute sizing
    sidebar = { width = 25 },
    main = { width = 80, height = 30 },
<


SEAMLESS BORDERS ~

When `seamless_borders = true`, the left border of the main pane is removed,
creating a seamless look with the sidebar. For best results, set `gap = 0`.

>lua
    {
      gap = 0,
      seamless_borders = true,
      border = 'rounded',
    }
<


EXIT KEY ~

The `exit_key` option controls which key closes the UI. This works in both the
sidebar and main window (in normal mode). In terminal mode, the key passes
through to the shell normally.

>lua
    {
      exit_key = 'q',     -- Default: press 'q' in normal mode to close
      -- exit_key = '<esc>',  -- Alternative: use Escape key
    }
<

**Note:** In the main terminal window, you must switch to normal mode (press
`Ctrl-\ Ctrl-n`) before the exit key will work. In terminal mode, keys pass
through to the shell.


CUSTOM COMMANDS ~

Define custom terminal commands with their own keybindings. This is useful for
frequently used tools like `lazygit`, `gitui`, Python REPL, etc.

>lua
    {
      custom_commands = {
        lazygit = {
          cmd = 'lazygit',
          key = '<leader>gg',
        },
        python = {
          cmd = 'python',
          key = '<leader>tp',
        },
        lua = {
          cmd = 'lua',
          key = '<leader>tl',
        },
        htop = {
          cmd = 'htop',
          key = '<leader>th',
        },
      },
    }
<

Each custom command: - Opens a new terminal with the specified command - Has
its own dedicated keybinding - Appears in the sidebar with the command name as
the title - Can coexist with your regular shell terminals


PERFORMANCE & DEBOUNCING ~

The plugin uses **debouncing** to efficiently handle high-output terminals
(build processes, logs, etc.):

>lua
    {
      activity = {
        enabled = true,
        debounce_ms = 100,  -- Wait 100ms after output stops before refreshing
      },
    }
<

**How debouncing works:** - When a terminal produces continuous output, the
sidebar waits until output pauses - Reduces CPU usage from ~1000 renders/sec to
~10 renders/sec during heavy output - Event-based design (no polling) - only
checks when terminal content actually changes

**Adjust for your needs:** - `50ms` - More responsive, slightly more overhead -
`100ms` - Balanced (default) - `200-500ms` - Less overhead, less responsive
updates

**To disable activity tracking entirely** (uses `jobwait` instead, no
`on_lines` callback):

>lua
    {
      activity = {
        enabled = false,
      },
    }
<


USAGE                                          *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-usage*


COMMANDS ~

  Command                Description
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  :AcTermUI              Toggle the multi-terminal UI
  :AcTermOpen            Open the multi-terminal UI
  :AcTermClose           Close the multi-terminal UI
  :AcTermNew [dir]       Create a new terminal (optionally in directory)
  :AcTermNext            Switch to next terminal
  :AcTermPrev            Switch to previous terminal
  :AcTermGoto N          Go to terminal N (by index)
  :AcTermFocusSidebar    Focus the sidebar
  :AcTermToggleSidebar   Toggle sidebar visibility
  :AcTermRename <name>   Rename current terminal

DEFAULT KEYBINDINGS ~

  Keybinding   Action
  ------------ ---------------------------
  <leader>tt   Toggle UI
  <leader>tn   Create new terminal
  <leader>tj   Next terminal
  <leader>tk   Previous terminal
  <leader>ts   Focus sidebar
  <leader>tp   Toggle sidebar visibility

SIDEBAR CONTROLS ~

When the sidebar is focused: - `j` / `<down>`: Next terminal - `k` / `<up>`:
Previous terminal - `1-9`: Jump to terminal by index - `n`: Create a new
terminal - `r`: Rename the current terminal - `q` / `<esc>`: Close the UI


TYPICAL FLOW ~

1. Open the UI with `:AcTermUI` or `<leader>tt`.
2. Create terminals with `:AcTermNew` or `n` in the sidebar.
3. Switch between terminals using `j/k`, `<leader>tj/<leader>tk`, or `:AcTermGoto N`.
4. Rename with `:AcTermRename` or `r` in the sidebar.


USE CASES ~

- **Project shells**: Keep per-project terminals in one spot.
- **Build/test loops**: Run commands and watch activity at a glance.
- **Git helpers**: Bind `gitui`, `lazygit`, or custom commands.
- **Scratch pads**: Quick one-off terminals without leaving the editor.


ADVANCED FEATURES ~


DYNAMIC WINDOW RESIZING

The UI automatically responds to window resize events. When you resize Neovim
(e.g., split window, zoom in/out), the terminal UI will reposition itself to
remain centered.

This works with both absolute and relative sizing. When using relative sizes
(e.g., `width = 0.6`), the UI will scale proportionally to the editor window.


TOGGLE SIDEBAR VISIBILITY

Hide the sidebar to give more space to the main terminal:

>lua
    -- Keybinding: <leader>tp
    -- Command: :AcTermToggleSidebar
<

When hidden: - The main terminal expands to fill the entire UI width - Terminal
list is hidden but cycling still works with `<leader>tj` / `<leader>tk` - Press
`<leader>tp` again to show the sidebar

This is useful when you need a larger terminal view but still want to keep the
UI open for quick cycling.


SILENT TERMINAL CYCLING

When you cycle terminals using `<leader>tj` (next) or `<leader>tk` (previous),
the focus stays on the main terminal window. The sidebar updates visually to
show the current selection (highlight and cursor move), but your typing focus
remains uninterrupted.

This means you can quickly switch between terminals without losing your place
or having to manually refocus the terminal.


SIDEBAR KEYBINDINGS ~

When focused in the sidebar:

  Key          Action
  ------------ ---------------------------
  j / <down>   Next terminal
  k / <up>     Previous terminal
  1-9          Jump to terminal by index
  n            Create new terminal
  r            Rename current terminal
  q / <esc>    Close UI

TERMINAL STATUS INDICATORS ~

The sidebar shows the status of each terminal: - ** (running)**: Terminal
has recent output/activity - ** (idle)**: Terminal is idle (no activity for
the idle threshold)


LUA API                                      *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-lua-api*

You can also use the plugin programmatically:

>lua
    local acterm = require('acterm')
    
    -- Toggle UI
    acterm.toggle()
    
    -- Open/close UI
    acterm.open()
    acterm.close()
    
    -- Toggle sidebar visibility
    acterm.toggle_sidebar()
    
    -- Focus sidebar
    acterm.focus_sidebar()
    
    -- Create new terminal (optional: specify working directory)
    acterm.new_terminal('/path/to/directory')
    
    -- Navigate terminals
    acterm.next_terminal()
    acterm.prev_terminal()
    acterm.goto_terminal(2)  -- Jump to terminal 2
    
    -- Rename current terminal
    acterm.rename_terminal('my-terminal')
    
    -- Open custom command (defined in setup)
    acterm.open_custom_command('lazygit')  -- Opens terminal with lazygit command
<


EXAMPLES                                    *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-examples*


BASIC USAGE ~

>lua
    -- In your init.lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      keys = {
        toggle = '<leader>tt',
        new = '<leader>tn',
        next = '<leader>tj',
        prev = '<leader>tk',
        focus_sidebar = '<leader>ts',
        toggle_sidebar = '<leader>tp',
      },
    })
    
    -- Press <leader>tt to toggle the UI
    -- Press <leader>tn to create a new terminal
    -- Press <leader>ts to focus the sidebar
    -- Press <leader>tp to toggle sidebar visibility for more space
    -- Use j/k in the sidebar to navigate between terminals
    -- Press r to rename a terminal
<


SIDEBAR TOGGLE ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      keys = {
        toggle_sidebar = '<leader>tp',  -- Quickly hide/show sidebar
      },
    })
    
    -- Press <leader>tt to toggle the UI
    -- Press <leader>tp to hide sidebar for more space
    -- Press <leader>tp again to show sidebar
    -- Use <leader>tj/k to cycle terminals (sidebar updates but stays unfocused)
<


CUSTOM COMMANDS ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      custom_commands = {
        -- Git tools
        lazygit = { cmd = "lazygit", key = "<leader>gg" },
        gitui = { cmd = "gitui", key = "<leader>gu" },
    
        -- Development tools
        python = { cmd = "python", key = "<leader>tp" },
        node = { cmd = "node", key = "<leader>tn" },
        lua = { cmd = "lua", key = "<leader>tl" },
    
        -- System tools
        htop = { cmd = "htop", key = "<leader>th" },
        bpytop = { cmd = "bpytop", key = "<leader>tb" },
      },
    })
<

**Note:** Custom command terminals appear in the sidebar with the command name
as the title. When you exit a custom command terminal, it’s removed from the
sidebar. If it’s the last terminal, the UI closes automatically.


ACTIVITY-BASED STATUS ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      activity = {
        enabled = true,
        poll_ms = 200,
        idle_ms = 1000,
        debounce_ms = 100,  -- Wait for output to pause before refreshing sidebar
      },
      status_icons = {
        running = "",
        idle = "",
      },
    })
<

**Performance tip:** Increase `debounce_ms` (e.g., to 200-500ms) for
high-output terminals like build processes or logs.


SCREENSHOTS                              *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-screenshots*

Placeholder for now. If you have a screenshot or gif, drop it in and update the
image link above.


COMPARISON                                *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-comparison*

acterm.nvim is optimized for a focused, always-visible terminal list and a
single main pane. It’s ideal when you want quick terminal switching with
minimal UI overhead rather than managing many splits or tabs.


RELATIVE SIZING (RESPONSIVE) ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      sidebar = {
        width = 0.2,   -- 20% of screen width
      },
      main = {
        width = 0.6,   -- 60% of screen width
        height = 0.6,  -- 60% of screen height
      },
      gap = 0,
      seamless_borders = true,
    })
<


LARGER UI FOR BIG SCREENS ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      sidebar = {
        width = 30,
      },
      main = {
        width = 120,
        height = 40,
      },
    })
<


CUSTOM STATUS ICONS ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      status_icons = {
        running = '[RUN]',
        idle = '[IDLE]',
      },
    })
<


MINIMAL STYLE ~

>lua
    require('acterm').setup({
      border = 'none',
      winblend = 0,
      seamless_borders = false,
    })
<


HOW IT WORKS                            *acterm.nvim-acterm.nvim-how-it-works*

The plugin creates two floating windows: 1. **Left pane (sidebar)**: Shows a
list of all active terminals with status indicators 2. **Right pane (main)**:
Displays the currently selected terminal

Terminals are regular Neovim terminal buffers that persist even when the UI is
closed. You can have multiple terminals running different processes and switch
between them easily.

The terminal status is automatically detected using Neovim’s job control,
showing whether a terminal has an active process or is idle.

**Terminal exit behavior:** - When you exit a terminal (e.g., type `exit` in
the shell), it’s automatically removed from the sidebar - If it’s the last
terminal, the UI closes automatically - If there are other terminals, the main
window switches to display the next available terminal
